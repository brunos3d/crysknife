## üö® What is Shai-Hulud Malware?

Shai-Hulud is a sophisticated malware that targets development environments, specifically:

- **Steals authentication tokens** from GitHub, NPM, AWS, and GCP
- **Creates malicious repositories** named "Shai-Hulud" containing encoded stolen data
- **Exfiltrates environment variables** and sensitive system information
- **Uses double base64 encoding** to obfuscate stolen credentials
- **Targets developers' workstations** and CI/CD environments

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

### Multi-Platform Detection

- **GitHub Account Analysis**: Scans for Shai-Hulud repositories and malicious data patterns
- **NPM Account Scanning**: Identifies compromised NPM accounts and malicious packages
- **Package Analysis**: Deep inspection of NPM packages for malware signatures
- **File Upload Analysis**: Direct analysis of leaked JSON data files
- **Base64 Decode Analysis**: Recursive base64 decoding and analysis of pasted data
- **Token Detection**: Identifies and safely displays stolen authentication tokens

### Security Features

- **Safe Token Display**: Masked token viewing with copy functionality
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis reports with downloadable JSON
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live scanning using GitHub and NPM APIs
- **Threat Assessment**: Clear indicators of compromise levels

### User Experience

- **Modern UI**: Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized analysis methods with clean tab navigation
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Search, file upload, and base64 paste options
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark theme compatibility
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, security-focused design

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Internet connection for API access

## üìñ How to Use

### Analysis Methods

Crysknife offers three different analysis methods through a tabbed interface:

#### 1. Search Tab

Choose from the dropdown menu:

- **GitHub Account**: Analyze a specific GitHub username
- **NPM Account**: Check NPM user accounts for compromise
- **NPM Package**: Inspect individual packages for malware

Enter the target (username, package name, or repository) and click analyze.

#### 2. Upload File Tab

- **Direct File Analysis**: Upload JSON files containing leaked data
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Simply drag a `.json` file to the upload area
- **Instant Analysis**: Immediate processing of uploaded malware data
- **File Validation**: Automatic validation of file format and structure

#### 3. Paste Data Tab

- **Base64 Input**: Paste base64-encoded stolen data directly
- **Recursive Decoding**: Automatic handling of nested base64 encoding
- **Real-time Validation**: Input validation without premature error messages
- **Flexible Input**: Handles various base64 formats and encoding levels

### 4. Review Results

- **Green**: No threats detected
- **Red**: Compromise detected with detailed information
- **Context-Aware Display**: Results show appropriate labels based on analysis method

## üîç Detection Methods

### GitHub Analysis

- Searches for repositories named `Shai-Hulud`
- Analyzes `data.json` files for encoded payloads
- Decodes double base64-encoded stolen data
- Validates malware data structure patterns

### NPM Analysis

- Scans package metadata for malicious patterns
- Checks descriptions and keywords for threat indicators
- Analyzes package dependencies and scripts
- Identifies suspicious package names

### Token Detection

- Identifies GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- Detects NPM authentication tokens
- Finds AWS and GCP service credentials
- Safely displays found tokens with masking

### File and Data Analysis

- **Direct JSON Processing**: Analyzes uploaded malware data files
- **Recursive Base64 Decoding**: Handles multiple layers of base64 encoding
- **Browser-Based Processing**: Client-side analysis for security and privacy
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Supports various data formats and encoding methods

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **API Integration**: GitHub REST API, NPM Registry API
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Architecture**: Atomic Design Pattern (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates)

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

Crysknife follows the Atomic Design methodology for a scalable and maintainable component structure:

### Component Hierarchy

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (SearchButton, StatusBadge, Logo)
- **Molecules**: Simple component groups (SearchInput, FileUpload, Base64Input, SearchForm)
- **Organisms**: Complex component sections (InputSource, AnalysisResults, HeaderSection)
- **Templates**: Page-level layout components (SecurityAnalysisTemplate)

### Key Components

- **InputSource**: Main organism containing tabbed interface for all analysis methods
- **SearchForm**: Molecule for traditional search-based analysis
- **FileUpload**: Molecule for drag-and-drop JSON file analysis
- **Base64Input**: Molecule for pasted base64 data analysis
- **AnalysisResults**: Organism displaying security analysis results with context-aware labeling

## üîí Security Considerations

### Safe Token Handling

- Tokens are masked by default
- No tokens are stored or transmitted to external services
- All analysis happens client-side when possible
- File uploads processed locally in browser

### Data Privacy

- **Local Processing**: File and base64 analysis performed entirely in browser
- **No Server Storage**: Uploaded files and pasted data never leave your device
- **Client-Side Decoding**: Base64 decoding happens locally for maximum privacy
- **Secure Analysis**: No sensitive data transmitted to external services

### API Usage

- GitHub and NPM APIs are used read-only
- No authentication required for public data
- Rate limiting considerations for heavy usage
- Respectful API usage patterns

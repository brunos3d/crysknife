## üö® What is Shai-Hulud Malware?

Shai-Hulud is a sophisticated malware that targets development environments, specifically:

- **Steals authentication tokens** from GitHub, NPM, AWS, and GCP
- **Creates malicious repositories** named "Shai-Hulud" containing encoded stolen data
- **Exfiltrates environment variables** and sensitive system information
- **Uses double base64 encoding** to obfuscate stolen credentials
- **Targets developers' workstations** and CI/CD environments

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

### Multi-Platform Detection

- **GitHub Account Analysis**: Scans for Shai-Hulud repositories and malicious data patterns
- **NPM Account Scanning**: Identifies compromised NPM accounts and malicious packages
- **Package Analysis**: Deep inspection of NPM packages for malware signatures
- **Token Detection**: Identifies and safely displays stolen authentication tokens

### Security Features

- **Safe Token Display**: Masked token viewing with copy functionality
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis reports with downloadable JSON
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live scanning using GitHub and NPM APIs
- **Threat Assessment**: Clear indicators of compromise levels

### User Experience

- **Modern UI**: Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark theme compatibility
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, security-focused design

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Internet connection for API access

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Select Analysis Type

Choose from the dropdown menu:

- **GitHub Account**: Analyze a specific GitHub username
- **NPM Account**: Check NPM user accounts for compromise
- **NPM Package**: Inspect individual packages for malware
- **NPM Repository**: Scan repository patterns

### 2. Enter Target

Type the username, package name, or repository to analyze.

### 3. Run Analysis

Click the search button to start the security scan.

### 4. Review Results

- **Green**: No threats detected
- **Red**: Compromise detected with detailed information

## üîç Detection Methods

### GitHub Analysis

- Searches for repositories named `Shai-Hulud`
- Analyzes `data.json` files for encoded payloads
- Decodes double base64-encoded stolen data
- Validates malware data structure patterns

### NPM Analysis

- Scans package metadata for malicious patterns
- Checks descriptions and keywords for threat indicators
- Analyzes package dependencies and scripts
- Identifies suspicious package names

### Token Detection

- Identifies GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- Detects NPM authentication tokens
- Finds AWS and GCP service credentials
- Safely displays found tokens with masking

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **API Integration**: GitHub REST API, NPM Registry API
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## üîí Security Considerations

### Safe Token Handling

- Tokens are masked by default
- No tokens are stored or transmitted to external services
- All analysis happens client-side when possible

### API Usage

- GitHub and NPM APIs are used read-only
- No authentication required for public data
- Rate limiting considerations for heavy usage
- Respectful API usage patterns
